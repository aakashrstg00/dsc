    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
    <h4>Purpose</h4>
    <p>
        A primary goal of DSC BVP is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds
        possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of
        gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

        gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).
    </p>
    <p>
        We invite all those who participate in DSC BVP to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
    </p>
    <h4>Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship</h4>
    <p>
        A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants
        to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.
    </p>
    <p>
        Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality
        and abuses of power that exist in society.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants
        to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.
    </p>
    <h4>Expected Behavior</h4>
    <p>
        The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

    <h4>Weapons Policy</h4>
    <p>
        No weapons will be allowed at DSC BVP events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct.
        Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used
        for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone
        seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without
        the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.
    </p>
    <h4>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h4>
    <p>
        Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be
        tolerated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate,
        up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund
        in the case of a paid event).
    </p>
    <h4>Reporting Guidelines</h4>
    <p>
        If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as
        soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise
        help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also
        provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.
    </p>
    <h4>Addressing Grievances</h4>
    <p>
        If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify DSC BVP with a
        concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.
    </p>
    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <p>
        We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code
        of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to
        community business.
    </p>
    <p>
        This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occuring outside the scope of community
        activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
